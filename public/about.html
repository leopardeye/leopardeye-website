            Trying to make <br>a differance</h2>
        <p>
            Amidst the transition from day to night, the African wilderness echoes with serenity - a time for
            introspection. Here, amid the modern world's chaos, nature extends its refuge to those yearning for an
            escape. <br><br>

            I am Roy, an individual driven by a quest to make a difference and unravel the fundamental questions that
            have echoed through humanity's history. I was born and raised in Namibia, to a strong genetic lineage of
            DRD4-7R. In my early years, I struggled with dyslexia and who knows what other learning disabilities. In
            those years the education system did not have the myriad of excogitate descriptions for those that did not
            conform to the norm. <br><br>

            During these pivotal years, my Grandmother, a sage figure, imparted wisdom through cryptic phrases.
            Reflecting on her words, three principles became the pillars of my foundation: "Every dark cloud has a
            silver lining", "Always look left and right" and "Take a step back." <br><br>

            While seemingly simplistic, taking a step back holds profound wisdom. Stepping out and observing situations
            from an objective standpoint yields deeper comprehension and, consequently, more holistic solutions. If
            everyone could intentionally ponder the repercussions of their actions, the world might not find itself in
            its current state. <br><br>

            At the core of conservation lies the principle of sustainable environmental utilization. Regrettably,
            humanity has often skewed this philosophy with greed and power lust. As custodians of this planet, we bear a
            colossal responsibility - not only to shield the environment but to rectify the missteps of our
            predecessors. <br><br>

            Through my photography and art, I aspire to kindle an appreciation for the natural world among those less
            fortunate, who haven't had the privilege of growing up surrounded by its splendour. <br><br>

            “In the end, we will conserve only what we love; we will love only what we understand and we will understand
            only what we are taught.” - Baba Dioum

        <h2 class="sub-head top-4rem">it's all the journey</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-subhead">not the destination for that is <br>already predetermined</h3>
        <p>
            In the tapestry of life, it's not just what we do that counts, but how we do it. Just as in our journeys,
            where appreciating the path is as vital as reaching the destination, so it is with our actions. Staring into
            the abyss of mortality has a profound way of reshaping one's perspective. Confronting our mortality serves
            as a catalyst for reevaluating the seemingly unyielding norms ingrained in us since birth. A life guided by
            societal expectations and predetermined paths suddenly unravels its inherent futility. <br><br>

            I, too, embarked on the conventional journey, crafting a life that I believed society expected. A career
            built through unwavering dedication, accumulating wealth often masked as debt—all in the pursuit of meeting
            societal norms and ensuring material comforts for my family. Then, life unveiled its paradoxical gift:
            cancer. While this statement may sound perplexing, this unexpected twist became the lens through which I
            glimpsed true significance. It marked a profound shift from the relentless pursuit of possessions to
            recognizing the authentic wealth found in purposeful and memorable endeavours. Countless tales in literature
            and songs echo with remorse for neglecting life's vital elements. <br><br>

            Amidst the perceived flaws surrounding the youth, there emerges a revitalizing resurgence of challenging the
            status quo. It's through questioning that growth unfolds, a principle holding true for every facet of life.
            My humble plea is for everyone to scrutinize the potential consequences of their actions. If we engage in
            this process consciously and with consideration, I am optimistic that, over time, we can collectively
            reshape the prevailing norms.

                    In this modern area, the difference between camera brands is so marginal that from a technical
                    perspective, it is nearly impossible to say that one is far superior to another. Canon, Fuji, Sony
                    and Nikon all have phenomenal equipment. However, for my objectives, I require a robust and
                    well-built system that can handle the abuse that Namibia's harsh environment throws at it. In my
                    opinion, the core essentials other than the camera and lens are a sturdy tripod, shutter release and
                    a good set of ND grad filters.</p>

                    involves mastering the art of anticipating how the sun's angle will illuminate a subject, how the
                    interplay of shadows and highlights can elevate or diminish a scene, and how the evolving hues due

                    transparencies? While I sometimes reflect on those moments with nostalgia, the convenience of modern
                    methods has alleviated many logistical challenges.

                    At the core of my post-production workflow lies Capture One, a robust package offering excellent

                    The term "spray-and-pray" is a common practice in wildlife photography. However, I propose a
                    different approach: slow down and anticipate the precise moment you wish to capture. Despite the
                    technological advancements allowing for rapid shooting up to 120 frames per second, I seldom utilize
                    high-speed burst on my camera. Perhaps it's a somewhat antiquated method from a bygone era.
                    Nevertheless, I firmly believe that to truly capture the essence of a subject, a profound
                    understanding is essential. My approach involves studying the behavior and mannerisms of the animal,
                    fostering a personal connection that translates into an image reflecting the magnificence of the
                    creature.</p>

                    As photographers, we bear a significant responsibility to ethically procure the images we capture.
                    In the context of wildlife photography, it is crucial to showcase images that do not endorse the
                    mistreatment of animals. Have you ever pondered the number of wild animals captured solely to
                    facilitate convenient photography experiences? Consider the leopards confined in cages across the
                    African continent, merely for the purpose of allowing tourists to capture an image. Reflect on the
                    animals euthanized each year due to well-meaning but misguided tourists feeding them, leading to
                    habituation that transforms them into nuisances or even threats to humans.</p>

    <h4 class="sub-subhead">A Dive into Essential Photographic Gear</h4>
    <p>
        In today's era, the distinctions between camera brands have become so minute that, technically speaking,
        declaring one vastly superior to another is a challenge. Canon, Fuji, Sony, and Nikon all boast exceptional
        equipment. However, navigating Namibia's rugged landscapes demands a robust and resilient system capable of
        withstanding its harsh conditions. Beyond the camera and lens, my essential toolkit includes a sturdy tripod, a
        shutter release, and a quality set of neutral-density graduated filters. <br><br>

        Aside from the photographic trinity (16-35, 24-70, and 70-200), my lens recommendations cater to specific needs:
        <br><br>

        Wildlife Photography:
        For Etosha, where wildlife might be at a moderate distance, a 400mm lens proves invaluable.
        In Dammaraland and Koakoveld, the versatility to extend up to 600mm becomes a significant advantage. A 200-600mm
        zoom lens from Sony or Nikon, known for internal zoom mechanisms, stands resilient against the dust prevalent in
        northern Namibia. While a 2x extender may compromise image quality, a 1.4x extender offers a viable solution for
        extra reach without significant degradation.
        <br><br>

        Landscape Photography:
        Namibia's expansive landscapes often call for focal lengths between 50-85mm, occasionally extending to
        200-400mm. For astrophotography, a fast wide prime lens proves crucial. Namibia's minimal light pollution
        results in spectacular night skies.
        <br><br>

        Macro Photography:
        Explore the smaller, lesser-photographed facets of Namibia with a 90-105mm Macro lens, allowing more distance
        between you and your subject.
        <br><br>

        Considering airline weight restrictions for travellers, I recommend lenses like the 14mm f1.4, 90mm or 105mm
        Macro, 16-35
        f2.8, 24-105 f4, 70-200 f2.8, and a 180-600mm with an optional 1.4 extender.
        <br><br>

        In the realm of filters, soft ND Grads (0.6 and 0.9) balance exposures, a polarizer enhances or eliminates
        reflections, and ND filters enable extended exposures.
        <br><br>

        A landscape photographer's backbone is their tripod. I still use an old REDGED with a Manfrotto geared tripod
        head for its precision, forcing me to slow down and deliberate over compositions.
        <br><br>

        Two last crucial aspects, in my opinion, are a shutter release and a quality camera bag. My gear resides in a
        B&W hard shell case, while my travels are facilitated by a Lowepro camera bag.
        <br><br>

        For those considering rental options in Namibia, while options are limited due to the market's economic nature,
        one company worth exploring is <a href="https://www.capturenamibia.com/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">www.capturenamibia.com</a>.

    <h4 class="sub-subhead">Exploring Indispensable Outdoor Essentials</h4>
    <p>
        Namibia's unforgiving terrain, marked by harsh conditions and scarce water sources, necessitates gear that is
        not just essential but also resilient. My essentials are, a sturdy set of Hiking boots, a robust backpack able
        to facilitate in carrying weight efficiently and a way to make a good coffee! <br><br>

         <strong>Footwear:</strong>
        In the untamed expanses of Namibia, where the quest for the extraordinary often leads you off the beaten path,
        the only trails to follow are those carved by zebras, tracing the contours of the land like nature's surveyors.
        Essential to this journey are supportive and comfortable hiking boots. Personally, I swear by the LaSportiva
        Trango Treks, striking the perfect balance between support and robustness. Their mountain DNA aids in
        shouldering heavy loads, alleviating the fatigue that comes from navigating challenging terrains. While footwear
        is a personal choice, <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/trango-trk-leather-gtx-man-brown-11y810317"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaSportiva</a> and <a
            href="https://world.scarpa.com/trail-shoes/trekking.html" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarpa</a> stand out among the brands I recommend, their reliability proven
        through countless adventures. <br><br>

         <strong>Backpack:</strong>
        Embarking on Namibian hikes and explorations marks a departure from modern ultralight gear trends. Despite the
        allure of shedding pounds, the weight of water remains an undeniable reality. The challenge lies in finding a
        balance; larger-volume backpacks often offer more comfortable load capacities, yet this isn't always ideal.
        Ideally, a 60-liter pack with a 40-50 kg capacity would be perfect. I've relied on the Osprey Argon 105, an
        excellent pack with one major drawback - it's wide at the base, causing snags in rough mountain terrains. For
        extended hikes in Namibia, I recommend only two pack systems:
        <a href="https://www.mysteryranch.com/terraframe-65-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mystery
            Ranch</a>
        or
        <a href="https://exomtngear.com/collections/k4-pack-systems/products/k4-3600-pack-system" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">EXO Mt Gear</a>
        , the latter being an
        ideal choice for arid environments. <br><br>

        <strong>Backpacking Camping Equipment:</strong>
        When it comes to backpacking camping equipment, my unequivocal recommendation is <a
            href="https://www.msrgear.com/ie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSR</a>. Their products are not
        only reliable but endure a lifetime of adventures. My gear includes the <a

            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dromedary® Bags</a>, while not the lightest option, have
        proven indispensable. After a mishap with ruptured water containers during a mountain expedition, I switched to
        the <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/ie/water-treatment/storage-bags/dromedary-bags/dromedary-bags.html"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dromedary® Bags</a> for their resilience in adverse conditions. In
        the realm of water, a few extra grams ensure
        security. <br><br>


         <strong>Other Essential Gear:</strong>
        In the rugged landscapes of the Namibian wilderness, inflatable sleeping pads offer undeniable comfort, but the
        unforgiving terrain often leads to frequent punctures. In this challenging environment, I strongly recommend
        close-celled foam mattresses, with the <a href="https://www.thermarest.com/ie/sleeping-pads/fast-and-light/z-lite-sol-sleeping-pad/z-lite-sol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Z Lite SOL™ Sleeping Pad</a> being the ideal solution. While reasonably
        comfortable within the constraints of its construction, it consistently provides a cushioned platform for a good
        night's sleep - unlike inflatable alternatives prone to air leaks. <br><br>

        <strong>Now, onto the subject of coffee!</strong>  For anyone, like myself, who relies on a good cup of coffee to tackle a long
        day on the trail, the <a href="https://gsioutdoors.com/products/30-fl-oz-javapress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 fl. oz. JavaPress</a> is a must. You'll always find one tucked inside my pack, ready for
        action regardless of the situation. <br><br>

        While the essentials of outdoor gear are vast, delving into each aspect requires a more in-depth exploration.
